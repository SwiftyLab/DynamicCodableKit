# Contributing Guidelines

This document contains information and guidelines about contributing to this project.
Please read it before you start participating.

_See also: [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

## Submitting Pull Requests

You can contribute by fixing bugs or adding new features. For larger code changes, we first recommend discussing them in our [Github issues](https://github.com/SwiftyLab/dynamic-codable-kit/issues). When submitting a pull request, please add relevant tests and ensure your changes don't break any existing tests (see [Automated Tests](#automated-tests) below).

### Things you will need

 * Linux, Mac OS (preferred), or Windows.
 * Git
 * [Swift](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/#installing-swift)
 * Optional
   * Xcode and [CocoaPods], to test [CocoaPods] integration
   * [Node], to use helper scripts in [Scripts](Scripts/) folder.

### Automated Tests

GitHub action is already setup to run tests on pull requests targeting `main` branch. However, to reduce heavy usage of GitHub runners, run the following commands in your terminal to test:

| Test category | With [Node] | Maually |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SPM integration | Run `npm run test` | Run `swift test` |
| [CocoaPods] integration (Requires Xcode) | Run `npm run pod-lint` | Run `pod lib lint --no-clean --allow-warnings` |
